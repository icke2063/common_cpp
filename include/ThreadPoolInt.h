 *
 * @brief  Framework for a "Threadpool". Therefore within this file the ThreadPool, WorkerThread and Functor
 * 		   classes are defined. The Threadpool shall be used to handle Functor
 * 		   objects. These functors are handled by WorkerThreads.
 * 		   The inherit class has to define the abstract functions with own or external thread
 * 		   implementations (e.g. boost).
